# Color Dunes

## Description

This is my project for the first half of the JavaScript module.
My goal is combine something like a screensaver, something beautiful to look at and a useful tool to find cool color palettes.

You can copy the color codes on desktop. On mobile Browsers this function is deactivated.

If you want to run the website on Local Host please use the `dist/` folder.
